  * Remove the realsense-to-laser node, as it's been axed from the core robot_bringup too
  * Add an accessories folder for launching additional nodes that would be part of the bringup on a real robot.  Currently populated with the corresponding realsense nodes from dingo_robot
  * Enable passing the config argument to dingo_description

ros-noetic-dingo-gazebo (0.1.0-2focal) focal; urgency=high

  * Revert to using dirname; i blanked on the conversation where we went over the new standards
  * Add the empty world launch file (useful for replaying bags w/o obstacles getting in the way)
  * Add spawn_dingo.launch for compatibility with the new simulation environments. Enable teleop by default in the simulations. Use $(find ...) instead of $(dirname) for improved compatibility with external packages
  * Unified launch files, added platform specific gains and updated dependencies.
  * [dingo_gazebo] Removed media.
  * Initial commit for handoff to tbaltovski; still some updates required
  * Contributors: Chris Iverach-Brereton, Jason Higgins, Tony Baltovski
