ros-melodic-dingo-gazebo (0.1.0-1stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Revert to using dirname; i blanked on the conversation where we went over the new standards
  * Add the empty world launch file (useful for replaying bags w/o obstacles getting in the way)
  * Add spawn_dingo.launch for compatibility with the new simulation environments. Enable teleop by default in the simulations. Use $(find ...) instead of $(dirname) for improved compatibility with external packages
  * Unified launch files, added platform specific gains and updated dependencies.
  * [dingo_gazebo] Removed media.
  * Initial commit for handoff to tbaltovski; still some updates required
  * Contributors: Chris Iverach-Brereton, Jason Higgins, Tony Baltovski
